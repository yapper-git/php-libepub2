# Epub on Wikipedia

EPUB (short for electronic publication; alternatively capitalized as ePub, ePUB,
EPub, or epub, with "EPUB" preferred by the vendor) is a free and open e-book
standard by the International Digital Publishing Forum (IDPF). Files have the
extension .epub.

EPUB is designed for reflowable content, meaning that an EPUB reader can
optimize text for a particular display device. EPUB also supports fixed-layout
content. The format is intended as a single format that publishers and
conversion houses can use in-house, as well as for distribution and sale. It
supersedes the Open eBook standard.

# NOTES

- **manifest**: list of the files in the .epub container, and their file type
- **spine**: list the reading order of the contents (i.e. the XHTML files, no images)
- **toc.ncx**: the table of contents
